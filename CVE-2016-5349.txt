static int qseecom_scm_call2    
   : does not exist - see comment on 'qseecom_scm_call'

static int __qseecom_send_cmd   
   : - all 64bit stuff does not apply and is omitted
   : - 'void *cmd_buf = NULL;' declaration was needed to be backported
   : - the 'if (qseecom.qsee_version < QSEE_VERSION_40) {' is always
   :   omitted, as the 64bit stuff is not relevant, so ONLY the code
   :   for the lower version is patched

static int __qseecom_update_cmd_buf
   : in this coding release, the respective request variable is 'cmd_req', 
   : and not 'req' as in the patchfile code

static void __qseecom_clean_data_sglistinfo   
   : backport was needed, as this func did not exist yet

long qseecom_ioctl      
   : only one switch/case condition to be patched

static int qseecom_check_whitelist_feature  
   : - again, the if-statement 'qseecom.qsee_version < QSEE_VERSION_40'
   :   is not implemented, as we don't have 64bit stuff
   : - the command call is 'ret = scm_call(' and not 'ret = qseecom_scm_call('
   :   'qseecom_scm_call' is a wrapper performing an if-statement for the 64bit
   :   stuff and either calls 'scm_call' (which is always relevant for us) or
   :   'qseecom_scm_call2' (see above, that's why we don't need it at all) for
   :   64bit
